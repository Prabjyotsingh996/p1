          The Grounded Teacher (GT) architecture addresses key challenges in Source-Free Unsupervised Domain Adaptation (SFOD) for object detection, such as noisy pseudo-labels, mode collapse, and class imbalance. Unlike traditional Student-Teacher
       frameworks that suffer from performance degradation due to biased pseudo-labels and EMA updates, GT introduces a Relation-Contextual Module (RCM) to model inter-class dynamics and biases, a semantic augmentation strategy that enhances
        minority class visibility using visually similar majority class samples from a curated Cropbank, and a Semantic-Aware Loss that prioritizes harder, underrepresented classes during training. Additionally, it leverages the strong zero-shot 
        representation capabilities of Vision Foundation Models (VFMs) to guide the student model, improving pseudo-label quality and mitigating domain shift. These innovations enable GT to learn robust, domain-invariant features and achieve 
        state-of-the-art performance (50.8 mAP) on Cityscapes â†’ Foggy Cityscapes, surpassing prior benchmarks by a significant margin.
